              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                The Scott Family, David, Beth, Taylor and Mary Beth have been
                blessed with opportunity, love, and support from our family,
                friends, and the community. We have also experienced tragedy. In
                2017, our eldest daughter, age 24, was diagnosed with stage 4
                Cancer, ( Metastatic Adnocarcinoma). As you might imagine, our
                family experienced denial, fear, hope, and pain and in late
                2019, we lost Taylor after a long fought battle. This story is
                about what we learned and how we grew emotionally and
                spiritualty through this experience. As Taylor battled cancer,
                we witnessed Taylor’s strength and determination through her
                courage, compassion, and faith in God. Taylor focused on helping
                others by providing emotional support and fundraising in an
                effort to help others and her efforts were inspirational to our
                family and others. We were inspired by the doctors and nurses
                who commit their lives helping others through this journey every
                day. We gained a heightened sense of empathy for our community
                as we entered the cancer world, which in some ways affects most
                all of us at some point. We became researchers and networkers in
                an effort to defy the odds of a terminal diagnosis. We would be
                remiss if I didn’t mention our dogs, Norman,, Winnie, Sophie and
                Blue who were always there for Taylor and our family and still
                offer us support every day. Taylor is a bright light who will
                continue to shine in our lives and through the ongoing work of
                the Taylor Ann Scott Foundation whose works are inspired by her
                compassion for all.
